but back today It is so high it was 200 thousand rupees. free but ==hundreds==  rupees.

And ==pesensese== who have no ==gabidel==

The who know, manybe after years to, when they accumulate that kind of debt, they were never able to pay back. 

where is the debt coming from?
It was coming from the seed, that cast 100 to 200 thound ==rupices==. per kilogramme depend on where they got

Seed they used to be free, ues to be theres.
==Past side== each time, the more they use the more they have to use. 12 price 15 price 20 price.

==past side== used, and justified the used in the  ==lairua?== area of india has ==showed up== by 2 thousand percent. that why the free market ==anglar== valuation has brought.

And when talk about the ==pesensese==, who have no money, who have no ==gabidel==
they can only buy the expensive seed and expensive ==paseside== by ==bring==

and who rent the money? the same company, that sell the ==past side== which is  the same company that sail the seeds 
, you know, and also the major **creditor**

I have been written for none fiction for years **actually**, but **secretly** wanting to be a novelist

when I first started writting at the age of 30 was with the intention of writting a fiction
but took a deep tour for 10 or 20years, and **wrote** no fiction
which have absolutely no regrate about it all

I think it was excetly right thing for me to do. But, it was that dream told the way and inside of me to do this and 

I remember reading something that you dear ==willate== to wrote  who is the greatest novestism of ==sibe== have begon for long song me exzactly.

she said no are very ==king and not resking== your ==neek==.
And I think she is abslotely right about that. It feel  that way to me at that time, and acturally feel me at everytime when I sit down  to write something

Finally, in the ==early nine-18==, 
I took me deep breath and starting write my fiction and feel risk to me at that time to do that.

It was the very first thing I written was I thought was going to be the first **chapter** of novel called "the secret life of bees".
I wrote it in 1992, and It is actually ==essentrally== the first chapter of the novel as it is now

language death and no main stream theatre, It is not main stream of anything. Can you image hollywood take it all
It is so far outside in the mainside of most people but they have difficult and ==prisiate==  for  the **crisis** all about,
beacuse they don't use to think about the language issues and themself.

Somehow we need to change this mind-sets,
we need to get people thinking more about language, more **specifically**, more **intermentely**, more **enthusiastic**.

Interesting language certainly there in the general population.

Most people are **fascinating** by such topic set: where words came from
what **origin** about their toungs;
name is all ;
whether their babies' name means anything;

and certainly **prepare** to play **scribe** on host language games for ==night them==.

And you get language game in video and television too

but willingless to focus on the language's general issues

and prepares it take on board the emotions  and drama in the ==herintin== the situation language **dangerousment** is not happend so much

many people often say things like animals ==through this==, but we don't. Or This animal they does this, that animals do that, but hunmans don't do things like that.
those statement have some  ==hittens== or ==consumption== that we are not animals

when we say animals do this， animals do that,we also assume that we are not animals
If we are not animals, what are we?

Are we plants, or trees, or flowers. No we are not.
Are we micro **organism** ( really tiny microscoop things). No, we are not.
Then nation conclusions must be that we are not living things.
That not true.

yes, we are animals.
And I see animals in us, and I see human in animals. So I am going to talk about animal behavior and hunman nature.

In order to understant hunman nature, we can look into animal's eyes, animal's behavior, and find something about what made us and who we are.

today I'd like to talk about water, the ==load== **surround** drinking water, talk about its quality, talk what you rights are to clear water,
to also give you a sense of what key threats are to drinking water.

what the ==exploser== might be and what we might do about it both ==legally== but also personally

Water is a critical **component** for our environment and our boby.Our body is close to 70% of water

You can go for ~~servel~~ **several** week, 2 to 3 average, whithout food, u can only go about 4 minites without air, and you can go maybe 4 or 5 days without water, before you die.

so water is absolutely critical, and one of the key argument I want to make tody is it's the ==galarge ...== about environment law,
givingly  ==wrapping== keys of our  knowledge about the chemical threat to water **quality**, and where is those threat come from

Ever try to get baby to smile? it is close to impossible
and ==sadowling== there it is,
that dreamly join grend,
while turn out those smile are ==simotinins==, they are for ==teegact==.
 
Researchers fount that when baby smile it's for ... reason, they are ever interacting with
**typically** the parents smile back.
And the time is just so they smile here they smile there. 
The researchers call it the **specific** timing.
 
The study of ~~jounarl~~ **journal** plus 1.

The researchers ==located it== really mother and quatified  interation which was called **categorize** ~~catigroris~~


1. Babys want to mask to their .. and smile to their mothers
2. They want to maxmiun the time mother smile to them
3. They want to experience  ==simotinins== smile
4. No smile at alll
 
By studying when smile happens, and what supsquence effect was, the investgator were able to figure out the goal of mother 70% of time was smile **simutaneously**.

while for babys 18% of them just make their mother smile to them.
 
While mother's interaction, while baby want to smile that.
so your baby may not to feel it or talk about to, ... or even turn over yet
 
but when they smail to, the babys seem to know what the up to

For the ==....== many scripts have many different ~~theroies~~ **theories** purpose for it.
Some people think some ==compelet== ==hooks==, it is now ==coreben== date  in 15 ~~centroy~~ **century**.
So it is most like the hope in 15 century hope which I personly don't believe.

But some people think the ==bioblidigal== is just an advanture for money some people made it and full people make money.

Other people think it is probablely a code, you know the way,
Someone used code locked a lot of secrets in it 
hopping to know and find out, if so it would be very successful because no one can create so far

But in my opinion, it actually is a genernal ==script== over here, a human **devise** ==script==,
but masking the ==hidded== the **general** human language.

The language seam have more if you are near easten maybe ==cocaine== Asian aspect too rather than **european**, because some of the words are decoded.

So I imaging if once we decodeed this script, we fond that its language is a **natural** language probably from the part of the word

let you can see from the relatively ==criket== and ==nerraw== street in the  city of roam
both today

you can see again those city grow at a hop way as I mentioned
It wasn't just pland at once time, but just grow up over time, begaining in 8 century BC.

It is interest because what we know about Roma is when they left their own devices
they could build this city from ==screach==  but they didm't let it grow in this way

they stracture it in a very ==mesodical== way, they were **basically** base on mimitary **strategy** mimitary planing.
the roma they couldn't **conquer** the word without ==abisily== masterfull military enterprise。
And wherever they went on there ever where was campions military campions. 
the would build camps and those camps always lay out on the very geomatic ==。。。== along the grad
usually ==scrile== or right ==antitangular==.
We begin to see the ideal  in roma's ccity turn to that so call casterm military camp or **military** design









campion 

camp
