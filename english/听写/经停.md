Hello this is ==megon== this week i would like to talk differents between translaters and ==detectors==.

it is common miscomsumption that translater and dections do the same things, I just like to highlight the few ...   differents between those two

Firstly, tanslation refers to writing communicating while the detecting refer to ==werb== communicating

so for example  the translators will not be ==attend== court during  translating the part **involved**
but would make the translator write avidence use in that case

secondly, both jobs requires  different skills, translators require the ability to write well and ==compartly==  into the target language.
This means you must have **excellent** command of ==certain== language

for example although I can speak and good understand it, I can not traslate english to french, 
although I can traslate from French to English, which means only helf way of it being a internation player

And as a ==dectoctors== you need to speak both language **frofessional**

thirdly, the **qualification** and experiment required to become eight to become experiment translator later or detector due ... 
both require years  of training  to ==reslovting== **qulification**
but all we can learn on the training would be very different

so just be clear that translator would translate the ==woden== text while the detectors will translate ==sumbal== cummunication

And if you like this video, like us.
