## sixth day in Ferbruary

Today,I call on my grandpa with my uncle.
become of today is the second day of the lunar year,and in this day,we should grave ancestors of own family.
my uncle burnt dry lawn by an accident at the head of grave.
we putted out the fire by informal tools. that made us spent a lot of energy.
Soon, we went back to the house of my grandpa.He asked me a lot about work.I relay don't know how to answer him, so I just hesitated to cope with the situation.

```you can also say in that way
it wastes a lot of our energy
```

## seventh day in Ferbruary

there maybe some substance in my Intestines.

there maybe two substances in my intesines scrambling for space.
so I have to put my finger in my intesine at the frist attempt that can make my shit go away.

Yesterday, I have just dropped a red ornamental on the windows.After a while, my mother put it on again,but it is still insecure when I set in my seat.

## eighth day in Freruary

i will substitute this substance with other substance

I spit on him, and he slap me, so I lost tooth

my perception is freedom

## tenth day of Freruary
